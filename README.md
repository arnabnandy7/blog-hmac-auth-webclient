# HMAC Auth with WebClient Demo
This project accompanies a blog found at https://andrew-flower.com/blog/Custom-HMAC-Auth-with-Spring-WebClient

It is an example of how to do HMAC-based auth using Spring's WebClient.

There are two subdirectories here corresponding to the two sections.
 * One focuses on using an Exchange Filter Function to add a header that signs the details of a GET request
 * The second shows how one might build a signing for a POST request, with body signing.
